# Learn Rust ðŸ¦€

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This is where I document my journey of learning the Rust programming language, sharing the resources, projects, and insights I've gathered along the way. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of Rust, I hope you'll find this repository useful.
 
## Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language (The Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Let's Get Rusty - The Rust Lang Book Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&si=ldobWHRCRxI8ha6o)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

*I decided to follow the [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html) of the Rust Book by Brown University*

## Sections (following The Book)

### Getting Started 

- The Book - [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch01-00-getting-started.html)/[original Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)
- [Let's Get Rusty - ULTIMATE Rust Lang Tutorial! - Getting Started](https://youtu.be/OX9HJsJUDxA?si=PhZ5Iv6Azi8azQf9)
- [Rustlings:](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) I did the intro exercises at this point.

### Programming a Guessing Game

- The Book - [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)/[original Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
- [Let's Get Rusty - Programming a Guessing Game in Rust!](https://youtu.be/H0xBSbnQYds?si=WubyeEfIZhSLnEnE) 

*The Let's Get Rusty video is great for this section. I found it very helpful to have someone explain it. I watched the video first and coded along the second watch. He also adds color which is a fun addition.*
