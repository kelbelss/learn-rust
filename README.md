# Learn Rust ü¶Ä

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This is where I document my journey of learning the Rust programming language, sharing the resources, projects, and insights I've gathered along the way. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of Rust, I hope you'll find this repository useful üë©üèº‚Äçüíª‚ú®
 
## Main Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language (The Book üìñ)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Let's Get Rusty - The Rust Lang Book Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&si=ldobWHRCRxI8ha6o)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

ü¶Ä *I decided to follow the [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html) of the Rust Book by Brown University*

## Sections (following The Book üìñ)

### 1. Getting Started

- The Book üìñ - [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch01-00-getting-started.html) or [original](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)
- Let's Get Rusty - [ULTIMATE Rust Lang Tutorial! - Getting Started](https://youtu.be/OX9HJsJUDxA?si=PhZ5Iv6Azi8azQf9)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - I did the intro exercises at this point.

ü¶Ä *If you plan to commit your progress to a single repository, I recommend adding a `.gitignore` file with `**/target/` and `**/Cargo.lock` to your root directory.*

### 2. Programming a Guessing Game

- The Book üìñ - [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) or [original](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
- Let's Get Rusty - [Programming a Guessing Game in Rust!](https://youtu.be/H0xBSbnQYds?si=WubyeEfIZhSLnEnE) 

ü¶Ä *The Let's Get Rusty video is great for this section. I found it very helpful to have someone explain it. I watched the video first and coded along during the second watch. He also adds color which is a fun addition.*

### 3. Common Programming Concepts

- The Book üìñ - [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html) or [original](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html)
- Let's Get Rusty - [Common Programming Concepts in Rust](https://youtu.be/2V0JaMVjzws?si=NAPRn5s_sazqWOAx) 
- Tech with Tim - [Rust Tutorial #4 - Data Types](https://youtu.be/t047Hseyj_k?si=M2P-K-_83AcgTQwW)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - I completed the exercises in 01_variables, 02_functions, 03_if, and exercises 1, 2 and 3 in 04_primitive_types. I also completed the first quiz in the quizzes folder.
- Practice - the Rust Book suggests building a program that can generate the [*n*th Fibonacci number](https://github.com/kelbelss/learn-rust/tree/main/rust-book/common_programming_concepts/fibonacci/src). I began with a [Fibonacci in Rust](https://benjaminbrandt.com/fibonacci-in-rust/) demonstration and then worked with Claude AI to break it down and understand it better. I added a non-recursive function and compared the time complexity of each using Rust's standard library's `std::time::Instant`. 

ü¶Ä *For Data Types I found the Tech with Tim video helpful, along with the Let's Get Rusty video. I reccommend reading The Book too, as the videos do not cover everything.*
